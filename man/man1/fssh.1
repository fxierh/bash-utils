.SH NAME
fssh \- SSH wrapper that removes the remote host entry from known_hosts before connecting

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fssh
[ssh options] user@hostname [command]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfssh\fR function is a wrapper around the standard \fBssh\fR command that adds
a preprocessing step to remove the specified host from the \fB~/.ssh/known_hosts\fR file.
This is particularly useful in environments where hosts frequently change their keys
(e.g., in dynamic cloud environments or when connecting to devices that may be reset to factory settings).
It supports all standard \fBssh\fR syntax, including passing options and executing remote commands.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBfssh\fR accepts the same options as \fBssh\fR.
For a complete list of options, refer to the \fBssh\fR manual page (\fBman ssh\fR).

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To connect to a remote host named "example.com" and automatically remove its entry from known_hosts beforehand:
.RS
.nf
fssh user@example.com
.fi
.RE
.PP
To connect using a specific identity file, removing the host from known_hosts:
.RS
.nf
fssh -i /path/to/id_rsa user@example.com
.fi
.RE
.PP
To execute a command on a remote machine, cleaning the known_hosts entry first:
.RS
.nf
fssh user@example.com "ls -lah"
.fi
.RE
